A Gaussian process in space and time is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process. In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous. See Sigrist, Kuensch, and Stahel (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12061> for more information on the methodology. This package aims at providing tools for two different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero. Covariates can be included in the model through a regression term.","Repository":"CRAN","SystemRequirements":"fftw3 (>= 3.1.2)","Maintainer":"Fabio Sigrist <fabiosigrist@gmail.com>","date":"2023-10-03T11:00:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Large Data Using a Spectral SPDE\nApproach","NeedsCompilation":"yes"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"concorR","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.1.0","License":"GPL (>= 2)","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"concorR","Version":"0.2.1","URL":"https://github.com/ATraxLab/concorR","crandb_file_date":"2020-11-25 22:38:39","Packaged":"2020-11-25 20:14:37 UTC; w039alt","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2020-11-25 20:30:07 UTC","downloads":235,"Authors@R":"c(\nperson(\"Tyme\", \"Suda\", email = \"suda.4@wright.edu\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(\"Adrienne\", \"Traxler\", email = \"adrienne.traxler@wright.edu\",\nrole = \"cre\", comment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0003-2725-0686\")),\nperson(\"Carter\", \"Butts\", email = \"buttsc@uci.edu\", role = \"ctb\",\ncomment = \"Author of sna::plot.blockmodel(), adapted for plot_blk()\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"f40fb7dffdaaeb23e4ce859669c1d895","Imports":"igraph (*), graphics (*), sna (*), stats (*), ","Author":"Tyme Suda [aut],\nAdrienne Traxler [cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2725-0686>),\nCarter Butts [ctb] (Author of sna::plot.blockmodel(), adapted for\nplot_blk())","Description":"Contains the CONCOR (CONvergence of iterated CORrelations)\nalgorithm and a series of supplemental functions for easy running,\nplotting, and blockmodeling.

The\nsame music data can be organized in tidy data frames for a familiar and\npowerful approach to the analysis of large amounts of structured music data.\nFunctions are available for mapping seamlessly between these formats and\ntheir representations of musical information. The package also provides an\nAPI to 'LilyPond' (<https://lilypond.org/>) for transcribing musical\nrepresentations in R into tablature (\"tabs\") and sheet music. 'LilyPond' is\nopen source music engraving software for generating high quality sheet music\nbased on markup syntax. The package generates 'LilyPond' files from R code\nand can pass them to the 'LilyPond' command line interface to be rendered\ninto sheet music PDF files or inserted into R markdown documents. The\npackage offers nominal MIDI file output support in conjunction with\nrendering sheet music.

It is articulated entirely around trophic levels. EcoTroph's key displays are bivariate plots, with trophic levels as the abscissa, and biomass flows or related quantities as ordinates. Thus, trophic ecosystem functioning can be modelled as a continuous flow of biomass surging up the food web, from lower to higher trophic levels, due to predation and ontogenic processes. Such an approach, wherein species as such disappear, may be viewed as the ultimate stage in the use of the trophic level metric for ecosystem modelling, providing a simplified but potentially useful caricature of ecosystem functioning and impacts of fishing.

The Savitzky-Golay\nmethod for data smoothing and differentiation calculates convolution\nweights using Gram polynomials that exactly reproduce the results of\nleast-squares polynomial regression. Use of the Savitzky-Golay\nmethod requires specification of both filter length and\npolynomial degree to calculate convolution weights. For maximum\nsmoothing of statistical noise in data, polynomials with\nlow degrees are desirable, while a high polynomial degree\nis necessary for accurate reproduction of peaks in the data.\nExtension of the least-squares regression formalism with\nstatistical testing of additional terms of polynomial degree\nto a heuristically chosen minimum for each data window leads\nto an adaptive-degree polynomial filter (ADPF). Based on noise\nreduction for data that consist of pure noise and on signal\nreproduction for data that is purely signal, ADPF performed\nnearly as well as the optimally chosen fixed-degree\nSavitzky-Golay filter and outperformed sub-optimally chosen\nSavitzky-Golay filters. For synthetic data consisting of noise\nand signal, ADPF outperformed both optimally chosen and\nsub-optimally chosen fixed-degree Savitzky-Golay filters. See Barak, P.

The framework for multiple-faction-leadership inference from coordinated activities or 'mFLICA' uses a notion of a leader as an individual who initiates collective patterns that everyone in a group follows. Given a set of time series of individual activities, our goal is to identify periods of coordinated activity, find factions of coordination if more than one exist, as well as identify leaders of each faction. For each time step, the framework infers following relations between individual time series, then identifying a leader of each faction whom many individuals follow but it follows no one. A faction is defined as a group of individuals that everyone follows the same leader. 'mFLICA' reports following relations, leaders of factions, and members of each faction for each time step.

The package requires two main inputs: i) Public transport data in the GTFS standard format; and ii) Some basic information on fleet characteristics such as fleet age, technology, fuel and Euro stage. As it stands, the package estimates several pollutants at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be calculated for specific transport routes, trips, time of the day or for the transport system as a whole. The output with emission estimates can be extracted in different formats, supporting analysis on how emission levels vary across space, time and by fleet characteristics.

Instead of focusing at specific scales, such as annual means or original grid resolution, we examine how their statistical properties change across spatio-temporal continuum.","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Yannis Markonis <imarkonis@gmail.com>","date":"2023-10-24T12:40:11+00:00","LinkingTo":"","BugReports":"https://github.com/imarkonis/csa/issues","Title":"A Cross-Scale Analysis Tool for Model-Observation Visualization\nand Integration","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"auto.pca","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"knitr (*), ","Type":"Package","Date":"2017-09-03","License":"GPL-2","revdeps":1,"Package":"auto.pca","Version":"0.3","Depends":"","crandb_file_date":"2017-09-12 09:26:54","Packaged":"2017-09-12 02:08:08 UTC; NSD","LazyData":"TRUE","Date/Publication":"2017-09-12 09:24:21 UTC","downloads":210,"Enhances":"","MD5sum":"3ba02fd178da6e227c05b9cda6a7cbe2","Imports":"psych (*), plyr (*), ","Author":"Navinkumar Nedunchezhian","Description":"PCA done by eigenvalue decomposition of a data correlation matrix, here it automatically determines the number of factors by eigenvalue greater than 1 and it gives the uncorrelated variables based on the rotated component scores, Such that in each principal component variable which has the high variance are selected.

All operations are performed on the logs of the ratios between the different argon isotopes so as to properly treat them as 'compositional data', sensu Aitchison [1986, The Statistics of Compositional Data, Chapman and Hall].","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Pieter Vermeesch <p.vermeesch@ucl.ac.uk>","date":"2018-10-03T20:52:31+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Rigorous Data Reduction and Error Propagation of Ar40 / Ar39\nData","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"postcards","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"testthat (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.1.2","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"postcards","Version":"0.2.3","URL":"https://github.com/seankross/postcards","crandb_file_date":"2022-01-07 04:50:27","Packaged":"2022-01-07 01:17:58 UTC; sean","Date/Publication":"2022-01-07 03:10:02 UTC","downloads":213,"Authors@R":"\nperson(given = \"Sean\",\nfamily = \"Kross\",\nrole = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\nemail = \"sean@seankross.com\",\ncomment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0001-5215-0316\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"0690b76f60216d1b4c7cf553227ce59c","Imports":"rstudioapi (*), utils (*), rmarkdown (*), ","Author":"Sean Kross [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5215-0316>)","Description":"A collection of R Markdown templates for creating simple and easy\nto personalize single page websites.","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Sean Kross <sean@seankross.com>","date":"2022-01-07T02:10:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","BugReports":"https://github.com/seankross/postcards/issues","Title":"Create Beautiful, Simple Personal Websites","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"SPlit","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.1.2","Date":"2022-03-22","License":"GPL (>= 2)","revdeps":1,"Package":"SPlit","Version":"1.2","Depends":"","crandb_file_date":"2022-03-22 09:50:41","Packaged":"2022-03-22 05:20:04 UTC; akhil","Date/Publication":"2022-03-22 08:00:08 UTC","downloads":213,"Authors@R":"\nc(person(\"Akhil\", \"Vakayil\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), email = \"akhilv@gatech.edu\"),\nperson(\"Roshan\", \"Joseph\", role = c(\"aut\", \"ths\")),\nperson(\"Simon\", \"Mak\", role = \"aut\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"f9ece635e41ab8e73b1b8931efd135fb","Imports":"Rcpp (>= 1.0.4), ","Author":"Akhil Vakayil [aut, cre],\nRoshan Joseph [aut, ths],\nSimon Mak [aut]","Description":"Procedure to optimally split a dataset for training and testing.\n'SPlit' is based on the method of support points, which is independent of modeling methods.\nPlease see Joseph and Vakayil (2021) <doi:10.1080/00401706.2021.1921037> for details.\nThis work is supported by U.S. National Science Foundation grant DMREF-1921873.","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Akhil Vakayil <akhilv@gatech.edu>","date":"2022-03-22T07:00:08+00:00","LinkingTo":"RcppArmadillo (*), Rcpp (*), ","Title":"Split a Dataset for Training and Testing","NeedsCompilation":"yes"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"mbsts","_score":1.0,"_source":{"NeedsCompilation":"no","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.2.1","License":"LGPL-2.1","Depends":"R (>= 3.5.0), ","revdeps":1,"Package":"mbsts","Version":"3.0","crandb_file_date":"2023-01-07 02:26:37","Collate":"'mbsts.forecast.R' 'mbsts_class.R' 'mbsts_function.R'\n'package.R' 'para.est.R' 'plot_comp.R' 'plot_cvg.R'\n'plot_prob.R' 'sim_data.R' 'tsc.setting.R'","Packaged":"2023-01-06 21:59:44 UTC; patricianing","Date/Publication":"2023-01-07 01:10:02 UTC","downloads":213,"Enhances":"","MD5sum":"0db992e0408a62e308eb240b41dc354e","Imports":"ggplot2 (*), reshape2 (*), matrixStats (*), methods (*), Matrix (*), MCMCpack (*), MASS (*), KFAS (*), BBmisc (*), pscl (*), ","Author":"Jinwen Qiu <qjwsnow_ctw@hotmail.com>, Ning Ning <patricianing@gmail.com>","Config/testthat/edition":"3","Description":"Tools for data analysis with multivariate Bayesian structural time series (MBSTS) models.

New wrapper functions for permutation tests or bootstrap of matrices of correlation are provided with the package. The third chapter is dedicated to data exploration with factorial analyses (PCA, CA, MCA, MDA) and clustering. The fourth chapter is dedicated to regression analysis: fitting and model diagnostics are detailed.

In RaSE algorithm, for each weak learner, some random subspaces are generated and the optimal one is chosen to train the model on the basis of some criterion. To be adapted to the problem, a novel criterion, ratio information criterion (RIC) is put up with based on Kullback-Leibler divergence. Besides minimizing RIC, multiple criteria can be applied, for instance, minimizing extended Bayesian information criterion (eBIC), minimizing training error, minimizing the validation error, minimizing the cross-validation error, minimizing leave-one-out error. There are various choices of base classifier, for instance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbour, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines. RaSE algorithm can also be applied to do feature ranking, providing us the importance of each feature based on the selected percentage in multiple subspaces. RaSE framework can be extended to the general prediction framework, including both classification and regression. We can use the selected percentages of variables for variable screening. The latest version added the variable screening function for both regression and classification problems.","Encoding":"UTF-8","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Ye Tian <ye.t@columbia.edu>","date":"2021-10-16T03:50:06+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Random Subspace Ensemble Classification and Variable Screening","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"eltr","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"testthat (*), rmarkdown (*), covr (*), knitr (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.1.1","License":"LGPL (>= 2.1)","Depends":"R (>= 2.10), ","revdeps":1,"Package":"eltr","Version":"0.1.0","URL":"https://randhirbilkhu.github.io/eltr/,\nhttps://github.com/RandhirBilkhu/eltr","crandb_file_date":"2021-01-16 11:15:31","Packaged":"2021-01-13 20:17:23 UTC; randz","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2021-01-16 10:20:02 UTC","downloads":203,"Authors@R":"\nperson(given = \"Randhir\",\nfamily = \"Bilkhu\",\nrole = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\nemail = \"rbilkhu7@gmail.com\")","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"3d0c43f69a39885901145ac24eca30ef","Imports":"data.table (*), ","Author":"Randhir Bilkhu [aut, cre]","Description":"Provides a tool to run Monte Carlo simulation of catastrophe model event loss tables, using a Poisson frequency and Beta severity distribution.","Encoding":"UTF-8","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Randhir Bilkhu <rbilkhu7@gmail.com>","date":"2021-01-16T09:20:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","BugReports":"https://github.com/RandhirBilkhu/eltr/issues","Title":"Utilise Catastrophe Model Event Loss Table Outputs","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"flexCWM","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","Date":"2020-03-27","License":"GPL-2","Depends":"R (>= 3.0.0), ","Package":"flexCWM","Version":"1.92","revdeps":1,"crandb_file_date":"2020-03-27 23:02:23","Packaged":"2020-03-27 17:01:35 UTC; angel","Date/Publication":"2020-03-27 22:30:02 UTC","downloads":203,"Enhances":"","LazyLoad":"yes","MD5sum":"85c36f8f20877df05780fa48e5387b47","Imports":"ContaminatedMixt (*), graphics (*), parallel (*), numDeriv (*), mclust (*), stats (*), statmod (*), ","Author":"Mazza A., Punzo A., Ingrassia S.","Description":"Allows maximum likelihood fitting of cluster-weighted models, a class of mixtures of regression models with random covariates.\nMethods are described in Angelo Mazza, Antonio Punzo, Salvatore Ingrassia (2018) <doi:10.18637/jss.v086.i02>.","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Angelo Mazza <a.mazza@unict.it>","date":"2020-03-27T21:30:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Flexible Cluster-Weighted Modeling","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"RImagePalette","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"scales (*), testthat (*), jpeg (*), png (*), ","Type":"Package","Date":"2016-01-05","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","Depends":"R (>= 2.1.0), ","Package":"RImagePalette","Version":"0.1.1","revdeps":1,"crandb_file_date":"2016-01-05 15:04:31","Packaged":"2016-01-05 13:50:12 UTC; joel","LazyData":"TRUE","Date/Publication":"2016-01-05 21:01:52","downloads":203,"Enhances":"","Imports":"ggplot2 (*), ","Author":"Joel Carlson","Description":"A pure R implementation of the median cut algorithm.\nExtracts the dominant colors from an image, and turns them into\na scale for use in plots or for fun!","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Joel Carlson <jnkcarlson@gmail.com>","date":"2016-01-05T21:01:52+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Extract the Colors from Images","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"dhsage","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.2.3","Depends":"R (>= 4.0), ","License":"GPL (>= 2)","revdeps":1,"Package":"dhsage","Version":"0.1.0","crandb_file_date":"2023-10-05 08:57:19","Packaged":"2023-10-04 09:20:33 UTC; Amir Computers","Date/Publication":"2023-10-05 07:00:02 UTC","downloads":203,"Authors@R":"c(person(\"Jamal Abdul\", \"Nasir\", role = \"aut\", email = \"dr.jamal@gcu.edu.pk\"), person( \"Andleeb\", \"Rani\", role = c(\"aut\"), email = \"diba.aulakh@gmail.com\" ), person( \"Muhammad\", \"Imran\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), email = \"imranshakoor84@yahoo.com\" ))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"011fcfb232ac34d06c2defd264d0cc75","Imports":"","Author":"Jamal Abdul Nasir [aut],\nAndleeb Rani [aut],\nMuhammad Imran [aut, cre]","Description":"We provide 70 data sets of females of reproductive age from 19 Asian countries, ranging in age from 15 to 49.

In practical interaction analyses, outliers in response variables and covariates are not uncommon. In addition, missingness in environmental factors is routinely encountered in epidemiological studies. The developed package consists of five robust approaches to address the outliers problems, among which two approaches can also accommodate missingness in environmental factors. Both continuous and right censored responses are considered. The proposed approaches are based on penalization and sparse boosting techniques for identifying important interactions, which are realized using efficient algorithms. Beyond the gene-environment analysis, the developed package can also be adopted to conduct analysis on interactions between other types of low-dimensional and high-dimensional data.

This greatly relieves the computational burden of generating the regression-function derivatives, which in turn can be fed into any optimization routine that utilizes such derivatives. The theorem guarantees that Hessian definiteness is preserved, meaning that reasoning about this property can be performed in the low-dimensional space of the base distribution. This is often a much easier task than its equivalent in the full, high-dimensional space. Definiteness of Hessian can be useful in selecting optimization/sampling algorithms such as Newton-Raphson optimization or its sampling equivalent, the Stochastic Newton Sampler. Finally, in addition to being a computational tool, the regression expansion framework is of conceptual value by offering new opportunities to generate novel regression problems.","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Alireza S.

These indices were selected, based on their direct and significant impacts on target sectors, after a thorough review of the literature in the field of extreme weather events and natural hazards. Overall, the selected indices characterize different aspects of the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events, and are derived from a broad set of climatic variables, including surface air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, cloudiness, solar radiation, and snow cover. The 138 indices have been classified as follow: Temperature based indices (42), Precipitation based indices (22), Bioclimatic indices (21), Wind-based indices (5), Aridity/ continentality indices (10), Snow-based indices (13), Cloud/radiation based indices (6), Drought indices (8), Fire indices (5), Tourism indices (5).","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Fergus Reig-Gracia <fergusrg@gmail.com>","date":"2021-04-09T23:00:03+00:00","LinkingTo":"","ByteCompile":"true","Title":"Climate Indices","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"neuronorm","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"MNITemplate (*), neurodata (*), ANTsR (*), RAVEL (*), rmarkdown (*), ITKR (*), extrantsr (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.1.1","Depends":"R (>= 3.5), ","License":"GPL-2","revdeps":1,"Package":"neuronorm","Version":"1.0.2","OS_type":"unix","crandb_file_date":"2022-09-23 21:20:38","Packaged":"2022-09-22 15:11:17 UTC; davidpayares","Date/Publication":"2022-09-23 20:50:02 UTC","Additional_repositories":"https://davidpayares.github.io/drat","downloads":192,"Authors@R":"c(person(given = \"David\", family = \"Payares\", email = \"davidpayaresg@gmail.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\")),\nperson(given = \"Jorge\", family = \"Mateu\", email = \"mateu@mat.uji.es\", role = \"ctb\"),\nperson(given = \"Wiebke\",family = \"Schick\",email = \"schickw@uni-muenster.com\", role = \"ctb\"),\nperson(c(\"Nicholas J.\"), \"Tustison\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Brian B\"), \"Avants\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Philip A.\"), \"Cook\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Yuanjie\"), \"Zheng\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Alexander\"), \"Egan\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Paul A.\"), \"Yushkevich\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"James C.\"), \"Gee\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"M.\"), \"Grossman\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Jean-Philippe\"), \"Fortin\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Elizabeth M.\"), \"Sweeney\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"John\"), \"Muschelli\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Ciprian M.\"), \"Crainiceanu\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Russell T.\"), \"Shinohara\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"Yongyue \"), \"Zhang\", role = \"cph\", email = \"NA\"),\nperson(c(\"J.

One of the main scientific goals of mMARCH sites is developing a better understanding of the inter-relationships between accelerometry-measured physical activity (PA), sleep (SL), and circadian rhythmicity (CR) and mental and physical health in children, adolescents, and adults. Currently, there is no consensus on a standard procedure for a data processing pipeline of raw accelerometry data, and few open-source tools to facilitate their development. The R package 'GGIR' is the most prominent open-source software package that offers great functionality and tremendous user flexibility to process raw accelerometry data. However, even with 'GGIR', processing done in a harmonized and reproducible fashion requires a non-trivial amount of expertise combined with a careful implementation. In addition, novel accelerometry-derived features of PA/SL/CR capturing multiscale, time-series, functional, distributional and other complimentary aspects of accelerometry data being constantly proposed and become available via non-GGIR R implementations.  To address these issues, mMARCH developed a streamlined harmonized and reproducible pipeline for loading and cleaning raw accelerometry data, extracting features available through 'GGIR' as well as through non-GGIR R packages, implementing several data and feature quality checks, merging all features of PA/SL/CR together, and performing multiple analyses including Joint Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), an unsupervised machine learning dimension reduction technique that identifies latent factors capturing joint across and individual to each of three domains of PA/SL/CR.  In detail, the pipeline generates all necessary R/Rmd/shell files for data processing after running 'GGIR' (v2.4.0) for accelerometer data. In module 1, all csv files in the 'GGIR' output directory were read, transformed and then merged. In module 2, the 'GGIR' output files were checked and summarized in one excel sheet. In module 3, the merged data was cleaned according to the number of valid hours on each night and the number of valid days for each subject. In module 4, the cleaned activity data was imputed by the average Euclidean norm minus one (ENMO) over all the valid days for each subject. Finally, a comprehensive report of data processing was created using Rmarkdown, and the report includes few exploratory plots and multiple commonly used features extracted from minute level actigraphy data.

Starting from the Ito-type equation describing the dynamics of cells duplication, death and differentiation at clonal level, we first considered its local linear approximation as the base model.\nThe parameters of the base model, which are inferred using a maximum likelihood approach,\nare assumed to be shared across the clones. Although this assumption makes inference easier,\nin some cases it can be too restrictive and does not take into account possible scenarios of clonal dominance.\nTherefore we extended the base model by introducing random effects for the clones.\nIn this extended formulation the dynamic parameters are estimated using a tailor-made\nexpectation maximization algorithm.

The model is based on a state-space representation for  irregularly observed time series data generated from a latent continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our Bayesian method adopts scientifically motivated hyper-prior distributions and a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler, producing posterior samples of the model parameters that include the time delay. A profile likelihood of the time delay is a simple approximation to the marginal posterior distribution of the time delay. Both Bayesian and profile likelihood approaches complement each other, producing almost identical results; the Bayesian way is more principled but the profile likelihood is easier to implement. A new functionality is added in version 1.0.9 for estimating the time delay between doubly-lensed light curves observed in two bands. See also Tak et al. (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-AOAS1027>, Tak et al.

One way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distributions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparametric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear & Begg (1992). The new approach potentially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear & Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Kaspar Rufibach <kaspar.rufibach@gmail.com>","date":"2015-07-03T12:51:10+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Estimation of Weight Functions in Meta Analysis","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"GenAlgo","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"xtable (*), Biobase (*), ","Date":"2020-10-13","Depends":"R (>= 3.0), ","License":"Apache License (== 2.0)","Package":"GenAlgo","Version":"2.2.0","revdeps":1,"URL":"http://oompa.r-forge.r-project.org/","crandb_file_date":"2020-10-15 19:08:41","Packaged":"2020-10-15 15:15:55 UTC; KRC","Date/Publication":"2020-10-15 17:40:03 UTC","downloads":181,"Enhances":"","LazyLoad":"yes","MD5sum":"bb3d55c59bdebc9768c5a51ee9403a09","Imports":"methods (*), ClassDiscovery (*), oompaBase (>= 3.0.1), MASS (*), stats (*), ","Author":"Kevin R.

EWS are a toolbox for policymakers to prevent or attenuate the impact of economic downturns. Modern EWS are based on the econometric framework of Kauppi and Saikkonen (2008) <doi:10.1162/rest.90.4.777>. Specifically, this framework includes four dichotomous models, relying on a logit approach to model the relationship between yield spreads and future recessions, controlling for recession risk factors. These models can be estimated in a univariate or a balanced panel framework as in Candelon, Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.03.015>. This package provides both methods for estimating these models and a dataset covering 13 OECD countries over a period of 45 years. In addition, this package also provides methods for the analysis of the propagation mechanisms of an exogenous shock, as well as robust confidence intervals for these response functions using a block-bootstrap method as in Lajaunie (2021). This package constitutes a useful toolbox (data and functions) for scholars as well as policymakers.","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Quentin Lajaunie <quentin_lajaunie@hotmail.fr>","date":"2021-02-24T09:30:06+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Early Warning System","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"gamRR","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","License":"GPL-3","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"gamRR","Version":"0.7.0","crandb_file_date":"2019-11-09 09:26:23","Packaged":"2019-11-09 07:07:48 UTC; dgdzc","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2019-11-09 07:30:02 UTC","downloads":189,"Enhances":"","MD5sum":"f9fe20f553bfe61d6a6d520818167b00","Imports":"graphics (*), mgcv (*), stats (*), boot (*), ","Author":"Zhicheng Du, Wangjian Zhang, Yuantao Hao","Description":"To calculate the relative risk (RR) for the generalized additive model.","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Zhicheng Du<dgdzc@hotmail.com>","date":"2019-11-09T06:30:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Calculate the RR for the GAM","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"rumidas","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"rmarkdown (*), knitr (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.2.3","License":"GPL-3","Depends":"R (>= 4.0.0), maxLik (>= 1.3-8), ","revdeps":1,"Package":"rumidas","Version":"0.1.2","crandb_file_date":"2024-02-17 11:51:36","Packaged":"2024-02-17 08:28:49 UTC; candi","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2024-02-17 11:00:02 UTC","downloads":189,"Authors@R":"person(\"Vincenzo\", \"Candila\", email=\"vcandila@unisa.it\", role=c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"714c8ede7a234a3521f738c1396b98cd","Imports":"tseries (>= 0.10.47), Rdpack (>= 1.0.0), roll (>= 1.1.4), zoo (>= 1.8.8), stats (>=\n4.0.2), utils (>= 4.0.2), lubridate (>= 1.7.9), xts (>= 0.12.0), ","RdMacros":"Rdpack","Author":"Vincenzo Candila [aut, cre]","Description":"Adds the MIxing-Data Sampling (MIDAS, Ghysels et al.

The Ordinary Least Square regressions (OLSv and OLSh), the Deming Regression (DR), and the (Correlated)-Bivariate Least Square regressions (BLS and CBLS) can be used with unreplicated or replicated data. The BLS() and CBLS() are the two main functions to estimate a regression line, while XY.plot() and MD.plot() are the two main graphical functions to display, respectively an (X,Y) plot or (M,D) plot with the BLS or CBLS results. Four hyperbolic statistical intervals are provided: the Confidence Interval (CI), the Confidence Bands (CB), the Prediction Interval and the Generalized prediction Interval. Assuming no proportional bias, the (M,D) plot (Band-Altman plot) may be simplified by calculating univariate tolerance intervals (beta-expectation (type I) or beta-gamma content (type II)). Major updates from last version 1.0.0 are: title shortened, include the new functions BLS.fit() and CBLS.fit() as shortcut of the, respectively, functions BLS() and CBLS(). References: B.G.

By\ngenerating a null distribution of the test statistics through repeated permutations of the response variable,\npermutation tests provide a powerful alternative to traditional parameter tests (Holt et al.

After generating a null\ndistribution of the test statistic through repeated permutations of the response variable, each observed t\nvalues would be compared to the null distribution to generate a p-value. To improve the efficiency,a stop\ncriterion (Anscombe (1953) <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1953.tb00121.x>) is adopted to force permutation to stop\nif the estimated standard deviation of the value falls below a fraction of the estimated p-value.

In addition, data often exhibit heavy-tails and thus it is also important to develop robust procedures. We aim to address this issue by replacing the least square loss with Huber loss function. We propose two algorithms to do robust factor analysis by considering the Huber loss. One is based on minimizing the Huber loss of the idiosyncratic error's Frobenius norm, which leads to a weighted iterative projection approach to compute and learn the parameters and thereby named as Robust-Matrix-Factor-Analysis (RMFA), see the details in He et al. (2023)<doi:10.1080/07350015.2023.2191676>. The other one is based on minimizing the element-wise Huber loss, which can be solved by an iterative Huber regression algorithm (IHR), see the details in He et al. (2023) <arXiv:2306.03317>. In this package, we also provide the algorithm for alpha-PCA by Chen & Fan (2021) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1970569>, the Projected estimation (PE) method by Yu et al.

To remedy this High dimensionality; low sample size (HDLSS) situation, we attempt to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the data before learning a classifier. That is, we project the data to a situation where the dimensionality is more manageable, and then are able to better apply standard classification or clustering techniques since we will have fewer dimensions to overfit. A number of previous works have focused on how to strategically reduce dimensionality in the unsupervised case, yet in the supervised HDLSS regime, few works have attempted to devise dimensionality reduction techniques that leverage the labels associated with the data. In this package and the associated manuscript Vogelstein et al. (2017) <arXiv:1709.01233>, we provide several methods for feature extraction, some utilizing labels and some not, along with easily extensible utilities to simplify cross-validative efforts to identify the best feature extraction method. Additionally, we include a series of adaptable benchmark simulations to serve as a standard for future investigative efforts into supervised HDLSS. Finally, we produce a comprehensive comparison of the included algorithms across a range of benchmark simulations and real data applications.","Encoding":"UTF-8","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Eric Bridgeford <ericwb95@gmail.com>","date":"2020-06-26T21:30:03+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Linear Optimal Low-Rank Projection","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"CircOutlier","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","Date":"2016-01-11","Depends":"circular (*), CircStats (*), ","License":"GPL (>= 2)","Package":"CircOutlier","Version":"3.2.3","revdeps":1,"crandb_file_date":"2016-01-12 02:47:20","Packaged":"2016-01-11 19:39:09 UTC; Admin","LazyData":"yes","Date/Publication":"2016-01-12 08:45:47","downloads":166,"Enhances":"","LazyLoad":"yes","Imports":"","Author":"Azade Ghazanfarihesari, Majid Sarmad- Ferdowsi University Of Mashhad","Description":"Detection of outliers in circular-circular regression models, modifying its and estimating of models parameters.","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Azade Ghazanfarihesari <azade_ghazanfari@yahoo.com>","date":"2016-01-12T08:45:47+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Detection of Outliers in Circular-Circular Regression","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"markdownInput","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.0.2","License":"GPL-3","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"markdownInput","Version":"0.1.2","URL":"https://github.com/juliendiot42/markdownInput","crandb_file_date":"2020-01-31 15:32:26","Packaged":"2020-01-20 09:50:20 UTC; julien","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2020-01-31 14:20:05 UTC","downloads":166,"Authors@R":"c(\nperson(\"Julien\", \"Diot\", email=\"juliendiot@ut-biomet.org\", role=c(\"aut\",\"ctb\", \"cre\"),\ncomment=c(ORCID=\"0000-0002-8738-2034\"))\n)","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"58828e4e885e108446920086cdd744a3","Imports":"shiny (>= 1.0.5), shinyAce (*), markdown (*), ","Author":"Julien Diot [aut, ctb, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8738-2034>)","Description":"An R-Shiny module containing a \"markdownInput\".

In this way, 'paleobuddy' can be used in complement to other simulators as a flexible jack of all trades, or, in the case of scenarios implemented only here, can allow for robust and easy simulations for novel situations.

The end result is a shell chronology consisting of estimated ages of shell\nformation relative to the annual cycle with their uncertainties. All formulae in the package serve this\npurpose, but the user can customize the model (e.g. number of days in a year and the mineralogy of the\nshell carbonate) through input parameters.","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Niels de Winter <niels_de_winter@live.nl>","date":"2021-07-05T11:40:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","BugReports":"https://github.com/nielsjdewinter/ShellChron/issues","Title":"Builds Chronologies from Oxygen Isotope Profiles in Shells","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"lipidomeR","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.0.2","License":"GPL-3","Depends":"R (>= 3.5.0), ","revdeps":1,"Package":"lipidomeR","Version":"0.1.2","URL":"https://tommi-s.github.io/","crandb_file_date":"2020-03-15 11:20:24","Packaged":"2020-03-06 18:08:12 UTC; tomsuv","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2020-03-15 10:20:02 UTC","downloads":163,"Authors@R":"c( person( \"Tommi\", \"Suvitaival\",\nrole = c( \"aut\", \"cre\" ),\nemail = \"TSUV0001@RegionH.DK\",\ncomment = c( ORCID = \"0000-0002-2583-4912\" )\n)\n)","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"d271fb42eba9c929d351cd8a2550be6b","Imports":"reshape2 (*), tableone (*), tidyr (*), stringr (*), limma (*), dplyr (*), shadowtext (*), BiocManager (*), knitr (*), ggplot2 (*), ","Author":"Tommi Suvitaival [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2583-4912>)","Description":"Create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistics with the 'lipidomeR'.\nThe 'lipidomeR' provides a streamlined pipeline for the systematic\ninterpretation of the lipidome through publication-ready visualizations\nof regression models fitted on lipidomics data.\nWith 'lipidomeR', associations between covariates and the lipidome\ncan be interpreted systematically and intuitively through heatmaps, where\nlipids are categorized by the lipid class and are presented on\ntwo-dimensional maps organized by the lipid size and level of saturation.\nThis way, the 'lipidomeR' helps you gain an immediate understanding of\nthe multivariate patterns in the lipidome already at first glance.\nYou can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistical associations, changes,\ndifferences, variation, or other lipid-specific values.\nThe heatmaps are provided with publication-ready quality and the results\nbehind the visualizations are based on rigorous statistical models.","Encoding":"UTF-8","biocViews":"","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Tommi Suvitaival <TSUV0001@RegionH.DK>","date":"2020-03-15T09:20:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Integrative Visualizations of the Lipidome","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"statGraph","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.3.0","Depends":"R (>= 4.3.0), graphics (*), stats (*), ","License":"GPL (>= 3)","Date":"2024-01-23","Package":"statGraph","Version":"0.5.1","revdeps":1,"URL":"https://www.ime.usp.br/~fujita/software.html","crandb_file_date":"2024-01-26 01:27:18","Packaged":"2024-01-25 15:17:34 UTC; grover","Date/Publication":"2024-01-25 23:40:02 UTC","downloads":163,"Authors@R":"c(\nperson(\"Diogo R.\", \"da Costa\", email=\"diogocost2@gmail.com\", role=c(\"aut\")),\nperson(\"Taiane C.\", \"Ramos\", email=\"taiane@ime.usp.br\", role=c(\"aut\")),\nperson(\"Grover E.\", \"Castro Guzman\", email=\"grover@usp.br\", role=c(\"aut\")),\nperson(\"Suzana S.\", \"Santos\", email=\"suzana@ime.usp.br\", role=c(\"aut\")),\nperson(\"Eduardo S.\", \"Lira\", email=\"edulira@ime.usp.br\", role=c(\"aut\")),\nperson(\"Andre\", \"Fujita\", email=\"andrefujita@usp.br\", role=c(\"aut\", \"cre\")))","LazyLoad":"yes","MD5sum":"e45e088b441c0c22bc0296d79c45ed8c","Imports":"methods (*), doParallel (*), foreach (*), parallel (*), MASS (*), rARPACK (*), cluster (*), igraph (*), ","Enhances":"","Author":"Diogo R. da Costa [aut],\nTaiane C.

Since potential output is a latent process, the estimation of the output gap poses a challenge and numerous filtering techniques have been proposed. 'RGAP' facilitates the estimation of a Cobb-Douglas production function type output gap, as suggested by the European Commission (Havik et al. 2014) <https://ideas.repec.org/p/euf/ecopap/0535.html>. To that end, the non-accelerating wage rate of unemployment (NAWRU) and the trend of total factor productivity (TFP) can be estimated in two bivariate unobserved component models by means of Kalman filtering and smoothing. 'RGAP' features a flexible modeling framework for the appropriate state-space models and offers frequentist as well as Bayesian estimation techniques. Additional functionalities include direct access to the 'AMECO' <https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-research-and-databases/economic-databases/ameco-database_en> database and automated model selection procedures.

Trees with a user-specified number of extant tips, or a user-specified stem age are simulated. It is possible to assume any probability distribution for the waiting time until speciation and extinction. Furthermore, the waiting times to speciation / extinction may be scaled in different parts of the tree, meaning we can simulate trees with clade-dependent diversification processes. At a speciation event, one species splits into two. We allow for two different modes at these splits: (i) symmetric, where for every speciation event new waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one species with new waiting times, and another that carries the extinction time and age of its ancestor. The symmetric mode can be seen as an vicariant or allopatric process where divided populations suffer equal evolutionary forces while the asymmetric mode could be seen as a peripatric speciation where a mother lineage continues to exist.

The MinED samples can be used for approximating the target distribution. They can be generated from a density function that is known only up to a proportionality constant and thus, it might find applications in Bayesian computation. Moreover, the MinED samples are generated with much fewer evaluations of the density function compared to random sampling-based methods such as MCMC and therefore, this method will be especially useful when the unnormalized posterior is expensive or time consuming to evaluate.

In 'ZetaSuite', we  have the following steps: QC of input datasets, normalization using Z-transformation, Zeta score calculation and hits selection based on defined Screen Strength.","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Junhui Li <ljh.biostat@gmail.com>","date":"2022-05-24T18:40:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Analyze High-Dimensional High-Throughput Dataset and Quality\nControl Single-Cell RNA-Seq","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"iplookupapi","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"testthat (>= 3.0.0), rmarkdown (*), knitr (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.2.3","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"iplookupapi","Version":"0.1.0","URL":"https://iplookupapi.com, https://iplookupapi.com/docs","crandb_file_date":"2023-05-11 10:03:37","Packaged":"2023-05-09 13:34:14 UTC; andreasaltheimer","Date/Publication":"2023-05-11 08:50:09 UTC","downloads":161,"Authors@R":"\nperson(\"Dominik\", \"Kukacka\", , \"dominik@everapi.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"9d1e8ffe4ea5e5c71612ac00b41d5f77","Imports":"jsonlite (*), httr (*), ","Author":"Dominik Kukacka [aut, cre]","Config/testthat/edition":"3","Description":"An R client for the 'iplookupapi.com' IP Lookup API.

'MR.RGM' facilitates the navigation of various data availability scenarios effectively by accommodating three input formats, i.e., individual-level data and two types of summary-level data. In the process, causal effects, adjacency matrices, and other essential parameters of the complex biological networks, are estimated.

A plane or 'map' is\nsubdivided into smaller areas called cells.  The cells in the map are\nscaled according to an underlying metric which allows to grasp the\nhierarchical organization and relative importance of many objects at\nonce. This package contains two different implementations of treemaps,\nVoronoi treemaps and Sunburst treemaps.  The Voronoi treemap function\nsubdivides the plot area in polygonal cells according to the highest\nhierarchical level, then continues to subdivide those parental cells\non the next lower hierarchical level, and so on. The Sunburst treemap\nis a computationally less demanding treemap that does not require\niterative refinement, but simply generates circle sectors that are\nsized according to predefined weights.

Recent Bayesian Markov chain Monto Carlo (MCMC) methods have been developed for big data sets that are too large to be analyzed using traditional statistical methods. These methods partition the data into non-overlapping subsets, and perform parallel independent Bayesian MCMC analyses on the data subsets, creating independent subposterior samples for each data subset. These independent subposterior samples are combined through four functions in this package, including averaging across subset samples, weighted averaging across subsets samples, and kernel smoothing across subset samples. The four functions assume the user has previously run the Bayesian analysis and has produced the independent subposterior samples outside of the package; the functions use as input the array of subposterior samples. The methods have been demonstrated to be useful for Bayesian MCMC models including Bayesian logistic regression, Bayesian Gaussian mixture models and Bayesian hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models.

Once the Moran's I value is rescaled, it facilitates the comparison between projects, for instance, a researcher can calculate Moran's I in a city in China, with a sample size of n1 and area of interest a1. Another researcher runs a similar experiment in a city in Mexico with different sample size, n2, and an area of interest a2. Due to the differences between the conditions, it is not possible to compare Moran's I in a straightforward way.

It basically indicates the deviance of simulation results from field observations. Once POMDEV scores and metropolis-hasting sampling on different model versions are effectuated, POMIC scores (Pattern Oriented Modelling Information Criterion) can be calculated.

TSS-RESTREND incorporates aspects of two existing degradation detection methods: RESTREND which is used to control for climate variability, and BFAST which is used to look for structural changes in the ecosystem. The full details of the testing and justification of the TSS-RESTREND method (version 0.1.02) are published in Burrell et al., (2017). <doi:10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.018>. The changes to the method introduced in version 0.2.03 focus on the inclusion  of temperature as an additional climate variable. This allows for land  degradation assessment in temperature limited drylands. A paper that details this work is currently under review. There are also a number of bug fixes and speed improvements. Version 0.3.0 introduces additional attribution for eCO2,  climate change and climate variability the details of which are in press in Burrell et al., (2020).

We extend this to consider self-inhibiting process and a non-homogeneous background rate. A log-Gaussian Cox process is a Poisson point process where the log-intensity is given by a Gaussian random field. We extend this  to a joint likelihood formulation fitting a marked log-Gaussian Cox model. In addition, the package offers functionality to fit self-exciting spatiotemporal point processes. Models are fitted via maximum likelihood using 'TMB' (Template Model Builder).

It is well known that the charging function of a EV is a concave function that can be approximated by a piece-wise linear function, so bigger the state of charge, slower the charging process is. Moreover, the other important function is the one that gives the electricity price. This function is usually step-wise, since depending on the time of the day, the price of the electricity is different. Then, the problem of charging an EV to a certain state of charge is not trivial. This library implements an algorithm to compute the optimal charging cost function, that is, it plots for a given state of charge r (between 0 and 1) the minimum cost we need to pay in order to charge the EV to that state of charge r.

Various types of structure of correlation are considered. It is also possible to analyse data (i.e., actually test difference in means) when these are available.

IAT scores are calculated as specified by Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.197>.    The output of this function is a data frame that consists of four rows containing the following information: (1) the overall IAT effect size for the participant's dataset, (2) the effect size calculated for odd trials only, (3) the effect size calculated for even trials only, and (4) the proportion of trials with reaction times under 300ms (which is important for exclusion purposes). Items (2) and (3) allow for a measure of the internal consistency of the IAT. Specifically, you can use the subsetted IAT effect sizes for odd and even trials to calculate Cronbach's alpha across participants in the sample.    The input function consists of three arguments. First, indicate the name of the dataset to be analyzed. This is the only required input. Second, indicate the number of trials in your entire IAT (the default is set to 220, which is typical for most IATs). Last, indicate whether congruent trials (e.g., flowers and pleasant) or incongruent trials (e.g., guns and pleasant) were presented first for this participant (the default is set to congruent).    Data files should consist of six columns organized in order as follows: Block (0-6), trial (0-19 for training blocks, 0-39 for test blocks), category (dependent on your IAT), the type of item within that category (dependent on your IAT), a dummy variable indicating whether the participant was correct or incorrect on that trial (0=correct, 1=incorrect), and the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds).

The goal of cyclostratigraphic studies is to define frequency/period in the depth/time domain. By conducting the continuous wavelet transform on cyclostratigraphic data series one can observe and extract cyclic signals/signatures from signals. These results can then be visualized and interpreted enabling one to identify/interpret cyclicity in the geological record, which can be used to construct astrochronological age-models and identify and interpret cyclicity in past and present climate systems. The 'WaverideR' R package builds upon existing literature and existing codebase. The list of articles which are relevant can be grouped in four subjects; cyclostratigraphic data analysis,example data sets,the (continuous) wavelet transform and astronomical solutions.

The recent transfer learning methods with statistical guarantees mainly focus on the overall parameter transfer for supervised models in the ideal case with the informative auxiliary domains with overall similarity. In contrast, transfer learning for unsupervised graph learning is in its infancy and largely follows the idea of overall parameter transfer as for supervised learning.\nIn this package, the transfer learning for several complex graphical models is implemented, including Tensor Gaussian graphical models, non-Gaussian directed acyclic graph (DAG), and Gaussian graphical mixture models. Notably, this package promotes local transfer at node-level and subgroup-level in DAG structural learning and Gaussian graphical mixture models, respectively, which are more flexible and robust than the existing overall parameter transfer. As by-products, transfer learning for undirected graphical model (precision matrix) via D-trace loss, transfer learning for mean vector estimation, and single non-Gaussian learning via topological layer method are also included in this package.\nMoreover, the aggregation of auxiliary information is an important issue in transfer learning, and this package provides multiple user-friendly aggregation methods, including sample weighting, similarity weighting, and most informative selection.\nReference:\nRen, M., Zhen Y., and Wang J.

Although our initial motivation\nwas to provide functions to analyze work loop experiment data, as we\ndeveloped the package we incorporated the ability to analyze data from\nexperiments that are often complementary to work loops. There are currently\nthree supported experiment types: work loops, simple twitches, and tetanus\ntrials. Data can be imported directly from .ddf files or via an object\nconstructor function. Through either method, data can then be cleaned or\ntransformed via methods typically used in studies of muscle physiology.\nData can then be analyzed to determine the timing and magnitude of force\ndevelopment and relaxation (for isometric trials) or the magnitude of work,\nnet power, and instantaneous power among other things (for work loops).\nAlthough we do not provide plotting functions, all resultant objects are\ndesigned to be friendly to visualization via either base-R plotting or\n'tidyverse' functions.\nThis package has been peer-reviewed by rOpenSci (v. 1.1.0).","Encoding":"UTF-8","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Vikram B.

Designed to accommodate a wide range of potential user objectives, 'rFIA' simplifies the estimation of forest variables from the FIA Database and allows all R users (experts and newcomers alike) to unlock the flexibility inherent to the Enhanced FIA design. Specifically, 'rFIA' improves accessibility to the spatial-temporal estimation capacity of the FIA Database by producing space-time indexed summaries of forest variables within user-defined population boundaries. Direct integration with other popular R packages (e.g., 'dplyr', 'tidyr', and 'sf') facilitates efficient space-time query and data summary, and supports common data representations and API design. The package implements design-based estimation procedures outlined by Bechtold & Patterson (2005) <doi:10.2737/SRS-GTR-80>, and has been validated against estimates and sampling errors produced by FIA 'EVALIDator'.

Relative to the control, peptides that are heavier by the mass of the labelling group are informative for sequence determination. Searching for peptides with such mass shifts, however, can be difficult. This package, designed to tackle this inconvenience, takes as input the mass list of two or multiple MALDI-TOF MS mass lists, and makes pairwise comparisons between the labeled groups vs. control, and restores centroid mass spectra with highlighted peaks of interest for easier visual examination. Particularly, peaks differentiated by the mass of the labelling group are defined as a “pair”, those with equal masses as a “match”, and all the other peaks as a “mismatch”.For more bioanalytical background information, refer to following publications: Jingjing Deng (2015) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2550-6_19>; Elizabeth Chang (2016) <doi:10.7171/jbt.16-2702-002>.","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Bo Yuan <yuanbo.faith@gmail.com>","date":"2019-08-09T09:10:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Search Tagged Peptides & Draw Highlighted Mass Spectra","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"zzlite","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"httptest (*), testthat (*), roxygen2 (*), rmarkdown (*), knitr (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.0.2","Date":"2020-03-17","License":"GPL-3","Depends":"R (>= 3.2), ","Package":"zzlite","Version":"0.1.2","revdeps":1,"crandb_file_date":"2020-03-18 16:32:46","Packaged":"2020-03-17 08:28:26 UTC; fkoh111","Date/Publication":"2020-03-18 15:20:02 UTC","downloads":115,"Enhances":"","MD5sum":"2698c39a6f1c7e634db063345746e5f8","Imports":"jsonlite (*), httr (*), ","Author":"Frederik Kok Hansen","Description":"A minor collection of HTTP wrappers for the 'Zamzar File Conversion'\nAPI.

This version of the algorithm relies on random forest algorithm to learn a large set of split points that conserves the relationship between attributes and the target class, and on moment matching optimization to transform this set into a reduced number of cut points matching as well as possible statistical properties of the initial set of split points. For each attribute to be discretized, the set S of its related split points extracted through random forest is mapped to a reduced set C of cut points of size k. This mapping relies on minimizing, for each continuous attribute to be discretized, the distance between the four first moments of S and the four first moments of C subject to some constraints. This non-linear optimization problem is performed using k values ranging from 2 to 'max_splits', and the best solution returned correspond to the value k which optimum solution is the lowest one over the different realizations.

Six questionnaires were used in the survey: (1) a household questionnaire to collect basic demographic information on all de jure household members (usual residents), the household, and the dwelling; (2) a water quality testing questionnaire administered in three households in each cluster of the sample; (3) a questionnaire for individual women administered in each household to all women age 15-49 years; (4) a questionnaire for individual men administered in every second household to all men age 15-49 years; (5) an under-5 questionnaire, administered to mothers (or caretakers) of all children under 5 living in the household; and (6) a questionnaire for children age 5-17 years, administered to the mother (or caretaker) of one randomly selected child age 5-17 years living in the household (<http://www.mics.unicef.org/surveys>).","Encoding":"UTF-8","VignetteBuilder":"R.rsp","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Muhammad Yaseen <myaseen208@gmail.com>","date":"2019-06-03T13:00:03+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2017-18 Birth History\nof Children Questionnaire Data for Punjab, Pakistan","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"TGS","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"R.rsp (*), testthat (>= 2.1.0), rmarkdown (*), knitr (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.1.0","License":"CC BY-NC-SA 4.0","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"TGS","Version":"1.0.1","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/14/272484,\nhttps://github.com/sap01/TGS","crandb_file_date":"2020-05-07 14:26:30","Packaged":"2020-05-07 11:38:49 UTC; Sap","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2020-05-07 13:00:21 UTC","downloads":106,"Authors@R":"c(\nperson(given = \"Saptarshi\", family = \"Pyne\", email = \"saptarshipyne01@gmail.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\ncomment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0001-9710-6749\")),\nperson(given = \"Manan\", family = \"Gupta\", email = \"guptamanan100@gmail.com\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(given = \"Alok\", family = \"Kumar\", email = \"alok4039@gmail.com\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(given = \"Ashish\", family = \"Anand\", email = \"anand.ashish@iitg.ac.in\", role = \"aut\",\ncomment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-0024-3358\")))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"fbe95f1b5c1c7a332cb5350418508d5e","Imports":"doParallel (*), foreach (*), bnstruct (*), ggm (*), minet (>= 3.38.0), rjson (*), ","Author":"Saptarshi Pyne [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9710-6749>),\nManan Gupta [aut],\nAlok Kumar [aut],\nAshish Anand [aut] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0024-3358>)","Description":"Rapid advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing\ntechnologies have resulted in genome-scale time-series datasets.\nUncovering the underlying temporal sequence of gene regulatory events\nin the form of time-varying gene regulatory networks demands\naccurate and computationally efficient algorithms.

Seed-mediated\noff-target effects occur when the ~8 nucleotides at the 5’ end of the guide\nstrand, called a seed region, bind the 3’ untranslated regions of mRNA,\ncausing reduced translation. Experiments using siRNA knockdown paired with\nRNA-seq can be used to detect siRNA sequences with potential off-target\neffects driven by the seed region. 'SeedMatchR' provides tools for exploring\nand detecting potential seed-mediated off-target effects of siRNA in RNA-seq\nexperiments. 'SeedMatchR' is designed to extend current differential\nexpression analysis tools, such as 'DESeq2', by annotating results with\npredicted seed matches. Using publicly available data, we demonstrate the\nability of 'SeedMatchR' to detect cumulative changes in differential gene\nexpression attributed to siRNA seed regions.","Encoding":"UTF-8","biocViews":"","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Tareian Cazares <tareian.cazares@lilly.com>","date":"2023-10-24T19:30:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"Find Matches to Canonical SiRNA Seeds in Genomic Features","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"stabreg","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","License":"GPL-3","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"stabreg","Version":"0.1.2","crandb_file_date":"2019-06-06 16:14:20","Packaged":"2019-06-05 17:21:06 UTC; oleg","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2019-06-06 14:20:03 UTC","downloads":88,"Authors@R":"c(person(\"Oleg Kopylov\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), email = \"okopy@protonmail.com\"), person(\"Sebastian Ament\", role = \"ctb\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"46ecd58d16a5af771fded741e8998dc4","Imports":"numDeriv (*), ","Author":"Oleg Kopylov [aut, cre],\nSebastian Ament [ctb]","Description":"Efficient regression for heavy-tailed and skewed data following a stable distribution.

Properly accounting for the intra-cluster correlations in the presence of data heterogeneity and long tailed distributions of the disease phenotype is challenging, especially in the context of high dimensional regressions. Here, we aim at developing novel Bayesian regularized quantile mixed effect models to tackle these challenges. We have proposed a Bayesian variable selection in the mixed effect models for longitudinal genomics studies. To dissect important gene - environment interactions, our model can simultaneously identify important main and interaction effects on the individual and group level, which have been facilitated by imposing the spike- and -slab priors through Laplacian shrinkage in the Bayesian quantile hierarchical models. The within - subject dependence among data can be accommodated by incorporating the random effects. An efficient Gibbs sampler has been developed to facilitate fast computation. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms of the proposed and alternative methods are efficiently implemented in 'C++'.

Nested cross validation (or analogous for the random forest) is used to estimate and compare performances between these models.\nFor some datasets, for example when the design matrix is not of full rank, 'glmnet' may have very long run times when fitting the relaxed lasso model, from our experience when fitting Cox models on data with many predictors and many patients, making it difficult to get solutions from either glmnet() or cv.glmnet().  This may be remedied with the 'path=TRUE' options when calling glmnet() and cv.glmnet().  Within the glmnetr package the approach of path=TRUE is taken by default.\nWhen fitting not a relaxed lasso model but an elastic-net model, then the R-packages 'nestedcv' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=nestedcv>, 'glmnetSE' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=glmnetSE> or others may provide greater functionality when performing a nested CV.\nAs with the 'glmnet' package, this package passes most relevant output to the output object and tabular and graphical summaries can be generated using the summary and plot functions.  Use of the 'glmnetr' has many similarities to the 'glmnet' package and it is recommended that the user of 'glmnetr' also become familiar with the 'glmnet' package <https://cran.r-project.org/package=glmnet>, with the \"An Introduction to 'glmnet'\" and \"The Relaxed Lasso\" being especially helpful in this regard.","VignetteBuilder":"R.rsp","Encoding":"UTF-8","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Walter K Kremers <kremers.walter@mayo.edu>","date":"2024-03-23T14:50:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","ByteCompile":"Yes","Title":"Nested Cross Validation for the Relaxed Lasso and Other Machine\nLearning Models","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"EcoDiet","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"testthat (>= 3.0.0), devtools (*), rmarkdown (*), knitr (*), ","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.2.1","Depends":"R (>= 3.5), ","License":"GPL (>= 2)","revdeps":1,"Package":"EcoDiet","Version":"2.0.1","URL":"https://github.com/pyhernvann/EcoDiet","crandb_file_date":"2024-03-25 21:26:49","Packaged":"2024-03-25 16:51:09 UTC; pyher","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2024-03-25 20:40:11 UTC","downloads":1,"Authors@R":"c(\nperson(\"Pierre-Yves\", \"Hernvann\", email = \"pierre.yves.hernvann@gmail.com\", role = c(\"cre\", \"aut\")),\nperson(\"Didier\", \"Gascuel\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(\"Dorothee\", \"Kopp\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(\"Marianne\", \"Robert\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(\"Jerome\", \"Guitton\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(\"Etienne\", \"Rivot\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(\"Heloise\", \"Thero\", role = \"aut\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"cec2dd09cce319366205788630da2658","Imports":"utils (>=\n3.6), ggmcmc (>= 1.1), coda (>= 0.19), jagsUI (>= 1.5.2), stats (>= 3.6), ggplot2 (>= 3.2), ","Author":"Pierre-Yves Hernvann [cre, aut],\nDidier Gascuel [aut],\nDorothee Kopp [aut],\nMarianne Robert [aut],\nJerome Guitton [aut],\nEtienne Rivot [aut],\nHeloise Thero [aut]","Config/testthat/edition":"3","Description":"Biotracers and stomach content analyses are combined in a Bayesian hierarchical model\nto estimate a probabilistic topology matrix (all trophic link probabilities) and a diet matrix\n(all diet proportions).\nThe package relies on the JAGS software and the 'jagsUI' package to run a Markov chain Monte Carlo\napproximation of the different variables.","Encoding":"UTF-8","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Repository":"CRAN","SystemRequirements":"JAGS (>= 4.3)","Maintainer":"Pierre-Yves Hernvann <pierre.yves.hernvann@gmail.com>","date":"2024-03-25T19:40:11+00:00","LinkingTo":"","BugReports":"https://github.com/pyhernvann/EcoDiet/issues","Title":"Estimating a Diet Matrix from Biotracer and Stomach Content Data","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"eiCircles","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"scales (*), ggplot2 (*), ","Type":"Package","RoxygenNote":"7.1.1","License":"GPL (>= 2)","revdeps":1,"Depends":"","Package":"eiCircles","Version":"0.0.1-7","crandb_file_date":"2024-03-24 20:02:52","Packaged":"2024-03-24 13:41:02 UTC; mariaamparo","Date/Publication":"2024-03-24 19:10:02 UTC","downloads":1,"Authors@R":"\nc(person(given = \"Antonio\",\nfamily = \"Forcina\",\nrole = \"aut\",\nemail = \"forcinarosara@gmail.com\",\ncomment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0001-5239-5495\")\n),\nperson(given = \"Jose M.\",\nfamily = \"Pavía\",\nrole = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\nemail = \"jose.m.pavia@uv.es\",\ncomment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0002-0129-726X\")\n)\n)","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"cddfb9f9393f00cc1b4d23994d4a51cd","Imports":"stats (*), NlcOptim (>= 0.6), ","Author":"Antonio Forcina [aut] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5239-5495>),\nJose M.

Hydrotime is a way to describe the relationship between water potential and seed germination rates at germination percentages. One important quantity before applying hydrotime modeling of germination percentages is to consider the proportion of viable seeds that could germinate under saturated conditions. This package can be used to apply correction factors at various water potentials before estimating parameters like stress tolerance, and uniformity of the hydrotime model. Three different distributions namely, Gaussian, Logistic, and Extreme value distributions have been considered to fit the model to the seed germination time course.

These tools allow incorporation of chemical\ntoxicokinetics (\"TK\") and in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (\"IVIVE\")\ninto bioinformatics, as described by Pearce et al. (2017)\n(<doi:10.18637/jss.v079.i04>). Chemical-specific\nin vitro data characterizing toxicokinetics have been obtained\nfrom relatively high-throughput experiments.   The\nchemical-independent (\"generic\") physiologically-based (\"PBTK\") and empirical\n(for example, one compartment) \"TK\" models included here can be\nparameterized with in vitro data or in silico predictions which are\nprovided for thousands of chemicals, multiple exposure routes,\nand various species. High throughput toxicokinetics (\"HTTK\") is the\ncombination of in vitro data and generic models. We establish the\nexpected accuracy of HTTK for chemicals without in vivo data\nthrough statistical evaluation of HTTK predictions for chemicals\nwhere in vivo data do exist. The models are systems of ordinary\ndifferential equations that are developed in MCSim and solved\nusing compiled (C-based) code for speed. A Monte Carlo sampler is\nincluded for simulating human biological variability\n(Ring et al., 2017 <doi:10.1016/j.envint.2017.06.004>)\nand propagating parameter uncertainty\n(Wambaugh et al., 2019 <doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfz205>).\nEmpirically calibrated methods are included for predicting\ntissue:plasma partition coefficients and volume of distribution\n(Pearce et al., 2017 <doi:10.1007/s10928-017-9548-7>).\nThese functions and data provide a set of tools for using IVIVE to\nconvert concentrations from high-throughput screening experiments\n(for example, Tox21, ToxCast) to real-world exposures via reverse\ndosimetry (also known as \"RTK\")\n(Wetmore et al., 2015 <doi:10.1093/toxsci/kfv171>).","Encoding":"UTF-8","VignetteBuilder":"knitr, R.rsp","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"John Wambaugh <wambaugh.john@epa.gov>","date":"2024-03-26T23:00:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","BugReports":"https://github.com/USEPA/CompTox-ExpoCast-httk","Title":"High-Throughput Toxicokinetics","NeedsCompilation":"yes"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"RISCA","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"","Type":"Package","Depends":"tune (*), splines (*), R (>= 4.0.0), relsurv (*), reticulate (*), survival (*), ","License":"GPL (>= 2)","revdeps":1,"Package":"RISCA","Version":"1.0.5","crandb_file_date":"2024-03-22 16:32:49","Packaged":"2024-03-21 22:21:25 UTC; foucher-y","Date/Publication":"2024-03-22 15:30:06 UTC","downloads":1,"Authors@R":"c(\nperson(\"Yohann\", \"Foucher\", email = \"Yohann.Foucher@univ-poitiers.fr\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"), comment =\nc(ORCID = \"0000-0003-0330-7457\")),\nperson(\"Florent\", \"Le Borgne\", email = \"fleborgne@idbc.fr\", role = \"aut\"),\nperson(\"Arthur\", \"Chatton\", email = \"arthur.chatton@etu.univ-nantes.fr\", role = \"aut\") )","LazyLoad":"yes","MD5sum":"4859a55e5903fd1b445509e7b5002d78","Imports":"nnet (*), glmnet (*), graphics (*), SuperLearner (*), kernlab (*), caret (*), cubature (*), mosaic (*), rpart (*), doParallel (*), parallel (*), foreach (*), date (*), MASS (*), nlme (*), mvtnorm (*), statmod (*), ","Enhances":"","Author":"Yohann Foucher [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0330-7457>),\nFlorent Le Borgne [aut],\nArthur Chatton [aut]","Description":"Numerous functions for cohort-based analyses, either for prediction or causal inference.

We deal with binary outcomes, times-to-events, competing events, and multi-state data. For multistate data, semi-Markov model with interval censoring may be considered, and we propose the possibility to consider the excess of mortality related to the disease compared to reference lifetime tables. For predictive studies, we propose a set of functions to estimate time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the possible consideration of right-censoring times-to-events or the presence of confounders.

The spike-and-slab quantile LASSO can handle data irregularity in terms of skewness and outliers in the disease trait, compared to its nonrobust alternative, the spike-and-slab LASSO, which has also been implemented in the package.

'LoopAnalyst' provides tools for the construction and output of community matrices, computation and output of community effect matrices, tables of correlations, adjoint, absolute feedback, weighted feedback and weighted prediction matrices, change in life expectancy matrices, and feedback, path and loop enumeration tools.","Repository":"CRAN","Maintainer":"Alexis Dinno <alexis.dinno@pdx.edu>","date":"2024-04-08T15:20:02+00:00","LinkingTo":"","Title":"A Collection of Tools to Conduct Levins' Loop Analysis","NeedsCompilation":"no"}},{"_index":"package","_type":"doc","_id":"mcgf","_score":1.0,"_source":{"Suggests":"doParallel (>= 1.0.17), foreach (>=\n1.5.2), parallel (>= 4.3.1), Rsolnp (*), dplyr (*), testthat (>= 3.0.0), rmarkdown (*), knitr (*), lubridate (*), ","RoxygenNote":"7.3.1","License":"MIT + file LICENSE","Depends":"R (>= 4.0.0), ","revdeps":1,"Package":"mcgf","Version":"1.1.0","URL":"https://github.com/tianxia-jia/mcgf,\nhttps://tianxia-jia.github.io/mcgf/","crandb_file_date":"2024-04-04 09:02:53","Packaged":"2024-04-04 00:09:43 UTC; tylar","LazyData":"true","Date/Publication":"2024-04-04 08:03:10 UTC","downloads":1,"Authors@R":"\nperson(\"Tianxia\", \"Jia\", , \"tianxia.jia@ucalgary.ca\",\nrole = c(\"aut\", \"cre\", \"cph\"),\ncomment = c(ORCID = \"0000-0001-5430-5019\"))","Enhances":"","MD5sum":"43651d47fa7cb336bce81f34a3113df8","Imports":"sp (*), MASS (*), ","Author":"Tianxia Jia [aut, cre, cph] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5430-5019>)","Config/testthat/edition":"3","Description":"Simulating and estimating (regime-switching) Markov chain Gaussian\nfields with covariance functions of the Gneiting class (Gneiting 2002)\n<doi:10.1198/016214502760047113>.
